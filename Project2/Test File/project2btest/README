Usage:
  %cd project2btest/
  %python2 project2b.py --test-path . --project-path path-to-your-xv6-kernel

(replace "path-to-your-xv6-kernel" with the actural path to your xv6 kernel.)

You can pass the "-h" flag to the script to see more testing options.
  %python2 project2b.py -h

===========================
!If you are failing a test!
===========================
All of the tests for 2b are user programs within xv6. You can find the code
for a test based on the test name. For the test "getpinfo", look for "getpinfo.c"
in this directory to see what it is testing/how you might be able to debug.
The tester itself can also work in debug mode, check the usage message for details.
